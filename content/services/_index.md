For general pentesting methodology and broad technique coverage, [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) remains the go-to reference — no point in rewriting what is already done well.

This section is different.

Here you will find **deep dives and case studies** on specific technologies and services encountered during real assessments or lab environments — enterprise platforms, industrial protocols, messaging systems, legacy services. Each entry goes beyond the basics: attack surface mapping, known CVEs with exploitation context, custom PoCs, tool-specific techniques, and edge cases that don't always make it into generic guides.

Think of it as field notes on specific targets.
