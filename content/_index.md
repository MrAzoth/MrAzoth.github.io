## $ whoami

Senior Cybersecurity Analyst with a deep focus on offensive security. I operate across web security, network infrastructure exploitation, Active Directory, wireless security, and emerging AI/LLM threat surfaces.

My approach is methodical and research-driven — understanding systems at a fundamental level before attempting to break them.

I built this site to stay organized, make someone's life easier, and have material ready when needed.

*If I can be of any help, I'm here.*
